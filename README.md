# Menu Planner & Recipe Finder

Problem solving: Planning meals can be hard. This app suggests recipes based on interested ingredients and helps organize meals

# MVP:
+ User Authentication: Let users sign up and save their data
+ AI-Powered Recipe Finder – Intelligent recipe suggestions based on user preferences and ingredients
+ My Fridge – A virtual fridge where users can add ingredients and track available amounts; ingredients update automatically when used in recipes
+ Meal Plan Creator – Design a meal plan for the day or week
# Additional Features:
+ Diet & Nutrient Tracking: Track calories, proteins, carbs, etc and generate daily/weekly reports
+ Diet Preferences: Filter by specific diets (vegetarian, keto, vegan, etc)
+ Import/Export (PDF/Excel): Export meal plans and shopping lists
More (hopefully not less) depending on creativity and available time

# Technologies to be used:
+ Frontend -> React;
+ Backend -> ASP.NET;
+ Database -> SQL;

Both feature ideas and technologies were chosen in a meeting(during a course) with both teammates, shared ideas!
