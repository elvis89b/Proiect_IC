Menu Planner & Recipe Finder

Problem solving: Planning meals can be hard. This app suggests recipes based on interested ingredients and helps organize meals

+ MVP:
Recipe Database: A list of recipes to start, expanding over time
User Authentication: Let users sign up and save their data
Dish Creation: Users can add new recipes
Recipe Search: Find recipes by available ingredients or dietary needs

+ Additional Features:
Recipes Based on Ingredients & Quantities: Users can add both ingredients and amounts to match more precisely corresponding recipes
Diet & Nutrient Tracking: Track calories, proteins, carbs, etc and generate daily/weekly reports
Dish Strategist: Design a daily/weekly meal plan
Diet Preferences: Filter by specific diets (vegetarian, keto, vegan, etc)
Import/Export (PDF/Excel): Export meal plans and shopping lists
More (hopefully not less) depending on creativity and available time

+ Technologies to be used:
Frontend -> React
Backend -> ASP.NET
Database -> SQL

Both feature ideas and technologies were chosen in a meeting(during a course) with both teammates, shared ideas!
